# Cat State Encoding
Cat State Encoding using Qutip

# Summary
As my master's thesis progresses, this repository will be further expanded.
Tasks:
  1. The work in [[1]](#references) is recreated in Qutip. [**Current**]
  2. Extend their work with different bosonic codes (N-cats?). [Future]
  3. Optimise with regards to arbitrary codes (not necessarily cat codes). [Future]
